# smart-rss-reader
The aim is to creat an Android app which reads my RSS and orders the feeds based on the probability that the user likes them.

To do list:
1) Fetch data from the RSS
	a) Download the whole HTML page for a proper offline experience
2) Tag extraction
3) Produce a summary
4) Group posts to remove the ones that speak about the same event (e.g. American elections)
5) After several time delete feeds that are not read
6) Add a button to add the selected content to buffer
7) Using all the info available plus a feedback given by the user to generate a ranking based on how likely is the user to like the content
